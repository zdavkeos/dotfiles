# zdavkeos dotfiles

## About

Repository of config files.  Originally I just had my Emacs config on
github, but as I collected more and more I realized I should just lump
everything together.  The current arrangement makes it easy to pick
and choose files when setting up a new system.

The idea and name stem from [Zach Holman's dotfiles
repository](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles),
though not nearly as fancy.

## Install 

Feel free to browse the files and settings. I have tried to
arrange like the files should appear in a home directory.  Any files
that start with `dot.*` are supposed to have the `dot` part removed.
This convention is just something I do -- I always seem to end up
losing them if they don't have it.
