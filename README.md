# zdavkeos dotfiles

## About

Repository of config files.  Originally I just had my Emacs config on
github, but as I collected more and more I realized I should just lump
everything together.  The current arrangement makes it easy to pick
and choose files as nescessary.

The idea and name stem from [Zach Holmans dotfiles
repository](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## Install 

Feel free to pick and choose files and settings. I have tried to
arrange like the files should appear in a home directory.  Any files
that start with `dot.*` are supposed to have the `dot` part removed.
The convention is personal -- I always seem to end up losing them if
they don't have it.
